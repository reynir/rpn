This is a proof of concept implementation of a simple reverse polish notation
calculator that uses the call stack as operand stack.

[Dan Søndergaard](https://github.com/dansondergaard) gave me the idea. It is
probably full of errors and undefined behaviour, but as long as one gives
correct input it should give correct output.

Values and operators are terminated by a newline. Currently the supported
operators are '+' and '-'.
